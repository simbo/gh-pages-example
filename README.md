## Goals of this project

Find and document a clean and convenient strategy to create and maintain a
github pages project where sources and generated contents are separate
branches.

Publishing updated contents should be handled in a way that is easy to
use and understand - preferably by just pushing updated sources to master and
letting travis build and deploy contents.


## Assumed preconditions

You have just created your new website project and your project root looks
something like this:

```
./
├─ dist/          # generated contents
├─ src/           # sources and templates
├─ .gitignore     # `dist` folder is ignored
├─ package.json   # project metadata and tasks
└─ README.md      # project information
```


## Configure repository and GitHub

``` sh
# initialize git
git init

# go to github, create the remote repository and add it locally
git remote add origin git@github.com:simbo/gh-pages-example.git

# commit everything (except the `dist` folder, which is added to `.gitignore`)
git add src .gitignore package.json README.md
git commit -m "initial commit"

# push master to github
git push origin master

# create a new orphan branch `gh-pages` and clear the working tree
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .

# create an `index.html` and add it to git
echo "Hello World" > index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "initial content"

# push `gh-pages` branch to github
git push origin gh-pages

# switch back to master branch
git checkout master
```

Go to repository settings on GitHub and check the *GitHub Pages* section.

Your branch `gh-pages` should be used as source and your content should then be
published at an URL like this: [simbo.github.io/gh-pages-example](https://simbo.github.io/gh-pages-example/)

## Managing updates


### …manually (not recommended)

You could simply clone the branch `gh-pages` to the `dist` folder within your
`master` branch.

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:simbo/gh-pages-example.git --branch gh-pages --single-branch dist
```

Now everytime new contents are generated by the build script, you could publish
them by committing them to the `gh-pages` branch:

``` sh
npm run build
cd dist
git add *
git commit -m "update content"
git push origin gh-pages
```

As simply as it seems, this manual method is error-prone as two repos are more
complex to manage manually.


### …using Travis CI

If not done already, register at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and install
the [travis client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb).

Enable travis support for your project using `travis init` and when asked for
main language, choose what fits your project (here we use `node`).

Now there should be a fresh generated `.travis.yml` in your project root.

Go to GitHub and get a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
Give it a useful description like `travis push-back` and select `public_repo` as
access scope.

After generating the token, add it encrypted to your travis config:

``` sh
travis encrypt GITHUB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token --add
```
